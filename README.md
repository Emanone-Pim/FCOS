# FCOS
Fully-Crypted-Operating-System

The purpose of this OS is to create a way of communicating with little chance of getting our message stolen.The idea is to stop any attempt at all steps of the communication.

The OS is on 2 USB-Key and when you boot on it just sends it's IP(encrypted) through tor network to a secured server who's only use is helping connect the two OS then the 2 computers create a link.

There are 2 passwords to decrypt the OS partitions which prevents anyone getting one of the key to use this system.
To avoid keyloggers the way the kernel uses the keyboard will be altered.
To avoid sniffing from someone on the router the message will be encrypted and will go through tor network.
The high level of encryption(ssh) should be enough to make intercepting the message useless.
The kernel will turn off the cam and mic so that they could be recorded.
The only function of the OS will be "newcircuit" which will change the keys and the tor network.
If any suspicion appears the "destroy" option will erase every tracks you might have left and both OS in the keys.
The idea is to leave nothing behind, wether it would be in the logs in the memory or in the register of the processor.
